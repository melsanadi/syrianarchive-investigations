Mohammed Jawad, a media activist in Hamoryah, spoke to Syrians for Truth and Justice about what happened on 22 February, saying: "At exactly 9:00 p.m., the city was targeted by five rockets loaded with incendiary substances that had been released through a “launcher” as well, causing burning of six houses which we were unable to extinguish. Moreover, the skies of Hamoryah lit up from the intensity of some fires that broke out because of this bombardment, but it extinguished on its own after devouring as many houses as possible."

Mohammed Jawad also spoke to Syrians for Truth and Justice for this incident, saying "At 10:00 pm, three rockets fell on Hamoryah all at once, and these rockets were mixed with other explosive rockets launched simultaneously by the regime from rocket launchers.
