Attacks using chemical weapons have been taking place in Syria since 2012. Official reports from the French Foreign Ministry and the United Nations put the number of attacks to 162.

The Syrian Archive has documented **212** chemical weapon attacks through documentation efforts of individuals and groups in Syria. Through working with Syrian civil society and by collecting information through YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, the Syrian Archive launched the Chemical Weapons Database on April 24 2018. This not only identified an additional 50 attack sites in Syria but has released 861 videos that corroborate these attacks.

This is the first publicly available collection of open source content documenting chemical weapon attacks in Syria between 2012 - 2018. The collection contains documentation of 212 attacks from over 190 sources that can be viewed, analysed and downloaded.

The Syrian Archive is a civil society group that has been documenting the Syrian conflict since 2014. Since then, 1.4 million videos have been located and preserved. Like many monitoring organisations, the Syrian Archive is unable to go into Syria to investigate these attacks. Relying on a network of journalists and video makers it is essential to monitor, document and report on the crimes in Syria and preserve these pieces of evidence for accountability and justice initiatives.
