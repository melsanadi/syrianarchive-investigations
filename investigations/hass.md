## What Happened and When?

On May 5th 2019, media reports were [published online by citizen reporters](https://www.facebook.com/wassemalon/posts/1173592712801596) and news agencies in Syria that Nabed Al Hayat Hospital located in Al Hass in Idlib province  is out of service as it was targeted with an airstrike.

Al Hass is a town in Idlib governate with a [population of 9595](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313044847/http://www.cbssyr.org:80/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB07-11-2004.htm) according to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics.

Nabed Al Hayat Hospital is supported by the [Syria for Humanitarian and Development - SRD](https://srd.org.tr/) which is a licensed organization in Turkey. They describe their mission on [their website](https://srd.org.tr/en/about) as the following: "Provide emergency humanitarian relief and sow the seeds of sustainable development for the people of Syria". Baladi News Agency [published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPRb71FGCgI&feature=share) on September 8th 2018 which shows an internal damage of Nabed Al Hayat hospital in previous attack to the recent one and the logo of the SRD appears in it.

SRD [published a statement](https://srd.ngo/srds-pulse-of-life-medical-hospital-attacked-destroyed/) about the attack on their website. Their founder stated the following:

> "Our hospital was one of the major trauma hospitals serving Idlib and northern Hama which has continuously been targeted this week. The people served will not be able to access life saving services as over 500 surgeries were performed here each month and over 5,000 patients were seen each month. The attack left parents and children, suffering in pain and with no medical assistance,” said Amany Qaddour, SRD’s Regional Director."

Orient [published a video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=660363207732616) on their facebook page showing the attack as it happened. Two munitions were dropped on the hospital directly as can be seen below. The sound of an aircraft can be heard at 01:43 of the video. The person capturing the video mentioned

### Prior Attacks on Nabed Al Hayat Hospital

This is not the first time Nabed Al Hayat Hospital is targeted. On Sep 8th 2018, SHAM Network published a video showing destruction of the hospital claimed to be as a result of an airstrike.

Bellingcat investigation team published an investigation about this incident on September 9th 2018.

## Flight Data Analysis


## De-escalation Zone
On 4 May 2017, the sponsoring states of Astana Talks (Russia, Turkey and Iran) signed a memorandum of understanding for the establishment of de-escalation zones in Syria which took effect on 6 May 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defence published a map showing the locations included in this memorandum as shown below (de-escalation zones in blue, ISIS in grey, Syrian army in orange). Al Hass is located within the de-escalation zone.

## De-confliction mechanism

Since September 2014 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has
operated a humanitarian deconfliction mechanism to identify and protect humanitarian staff, offices, facilities, distribution sites, IDP sites, routes mobile clinics travel, etc. to the extent possible during kinetic operations by the Coalition Forces (“CF”) in Syria.

The Russian Federation and the Republic of Turkey air forces were not part of this original 2014 process; however, an agreement is in place with both countries to deconflict movement and static locations provided by humanitarian organizations.

The Co-Founder of the hospital Joumana Qaddour published a tweet mentioning that the hospital was part of the deconfliction agreement.
This was also [published in a statement](https://srd.ngo/srds-pulse-of-life-medical-hospital-attacked-destroyed/) by the SRD which included:

>"This hospital’s coordinates had previously been shared with UN OCHA as part of its formal deconfliction mechanism, yet it was still directly targeted."
