Attacks using chemical weapons have been taking place in Syria since 2012. As of April 2018, official reports from the [French Foreign Ministry](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/170425_-_national_evaluation_annex_-_anglais_cle81722e.pdf) and the [Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic](http://www.ohchr.org/SiteCollectionImages/Bodies/HRCouncil/IICISyria/COISyria_ChemicalWeapons.jpg) put the number of chemical attacks at 163.

The Syrian Archive has documented **212** chemical weapon attacks through documentation efforts of individuals and groups in Syria. Through working with Syrian civil society and by discovering, collecting and verifying information through YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, the Syrian Archive launched the Chemical Weapons Database on April 24 2018. This process not only identified an additional 50 attack sites in Syria but brought together **861** verified videos to corroborate these attacks.
