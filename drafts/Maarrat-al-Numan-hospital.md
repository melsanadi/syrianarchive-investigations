## Background of Maarat al-Numaan

Maarat al-Numaan (also known as al-Maarra) is a city located 33 km south of Idlib, with a population of about 58,008 (2004 census), and so it's considered as the second largest city in Idlib. Al-Maarra has a long history, and its [museum has mosaics](http://www.esyria.sy/eidleb/index.php?p=stories&category=ruins&filename=200801071848011) from Dead Cities, which date back to 1st to 7th centuries.

The demonstrations in Maarat al-Numaan started with the beginning of the Syrian uprising, [this video shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptgRwJ0tGq8) one of the first demonstrations there which date back to 24 April 2011, chanted for freedom and Daraa. In most demonstrations [the intervention of security forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_8a7FlJMAU) to break up them had been reported.

Also the city has been seen [number of defection of military officers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp29oYjAGRQ), and swiftly became an important hub for [organizing protests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfLaZ1G3s20). The tenth month of 2012 saw [the control of Free Syrian Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aralZ54lXs) (FSA) on Maarat al-Numaan and since that date the city still out of the Syrian government control.

On 13 March 2016 al-Nusra Front and Jund al-Aqsa [attacked](https://apnews.com/5eefe3dd4c2045c3b2277fcb8276bda9) the Free Syrian Army’s Division 13 in Maarat al-Numaan, overrun their depots, killing 4 of combatants and wounding as many as 20 others during the battle. Two Division's storage facilities that filled with the U.S. manufactured anti-tank TOW missiles were surrendered to the al-Nusra. Ahmad al-Saaoud, a Syrian rebel commander, said the attackers had seized light weapons and ammunition from his group but had not managed to capture any TOW anti-tank missiles.

[Civilian opposition against al-Nusra](http://stepagency-sy.net/archives/94904) continued for several months in al-Maarra, until 6 June 2016 where the clashes broke out again. On 9 June, [an agreement was signed](https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/873483701140811776) between the Free Idlib Army and Tahrir al-Sham, which requires the Division 13 to be knocked down, the Free Idlib Army will also take over all the headquarters of Division 13 except one which will be managed by Tahrir al-Sham.

### Al-Salaam Hospital

Al Salaam Hospital is a maternity hospital, which founded in 1995 in Maarat al-Numan. It contains all medical departments, including women's clinics, orthopedics, and general surgery.

Before Jan 03 2018, the hospital treats approximately 8,000 to 9,000 patients per month. Last month, the [hospital delivered 674 babies](https://www.sams-usa.net/press_release/maternity-hospital-maarat-al-numan-city-destroyed-following-three-attacks-four-days/), and [the total number of beneficiaries](https://www.facebook.com/alsalam.Hospital2/photos/a.390735564429659.1073741860.182840021885882/870621066441104/?type=3) from its services reached 8670 patients, including 1789 in the internal clinic, 3356 in the pediatrics clinic, 2668 in the women's clinics, and hundreds of other patients in different clinics:

Al Salaam Hospital is the only maternity hospital in Maarat al-Numan, providing emergency services, medical consultations, as well as deliveries.

### Previous Attack on Idib's Hospitals

The Syrian Archive has done in-depth two open source analysis about targeting medical facilities in Idlib governorate. The first was entitled [Medical Facilities Under Fire](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Medical-Facilities-Under-Fire/) which addressed targeting eight hospitals and medical points including [The national hospital of Marret Numan](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Medical-Facilities-Under-Fire/Incident-1.html) whose beneficiaries was estimated about 500,000 people. The second report was under the heading [Three Idlib Medical Facilities Attacked](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Three-Idlib-Medical-Facilities-Attacked.html) and provided overviews of visual content regarding attacks targeted some of Idlib's hospital and medical points.

This report presents an in-depth analysis of the last attacks on Al-Salaam hospital especially the last one which resulted of it being out of service.

### De-escalation zone

On 4 May 2017, the sponsoring states of Astana Talks (Russia, Turkey, and Iran) [signed a memorandum of understanding for the establishment of de-escalation zones in Syria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF-gIL8yzk) for at least six months, which [was extended](https://sana.sy/en/?p=116911]) at Astana 7 on 31 October 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defense [published a map showing](https://function.mil.ru/news_page/intrel/more.htm?id=12121964%40egNews) the locations included in this memorandum as shown below (de-escalation zones in blue, ISIS in grey, Syrian army in orange). See below:

![Russian MOD video](assets/atarib-3.png)

![Map of de-escalation zone](assets/atarib-4.png)

These areas included Idlib province, some parts of northern Homs province, as well as some parts of adjacent provinces (Latakia, Hama, and Aleppo), Eastern Ghouta in Damascus countryside and some parts of southern Syria.

A zoomed in look at the Russian Ministry of Defense’s map (above) clearly shows that the bombed location in Maarat al-Numan city is part of the de-escalation zone established during the Astana talks.

## What Happened?

On 03 Jan 2018 between 11:38 AM and 12:00 AM (in Damascus local time), al-Salaam hospital in Maarat al-Numan was attacked allegedly by Russian air force. The hospital was serving approximately 500,000 people. The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), who supported the hospital, published a  [report](https://www.sams-usa.net/press_release/maternity-hospital-maarat-al-numan-city-destroyed-following-three-attacks-four-days/) alleged that Al-Salaam hospital was previously attacked three times since 30 Dec 2017 [we couldn't find any open source information about those attacks]. The report stated that the last airstrikes 'killing five people, including a newborn baby girl and her father, and injuring many more'.

[SAMS published a video](https://www.facebook.com/sams.arabic/videos/1209630115836875/) on their Facebook page showing the hospital from the inside immediately after the attack. In the evening SAMS [reported](https://www.facebook.com/sams.arabic/videos/1209757322490821/): "Al-Salaam hospital in Maarat al-Numan was becoming out of order, after violent attacks against it caused significant material damage, and its medical staff and patients were evacuated. A newborn baby girl was killed two hours later after she has been born in the hospital and another was injured as a result of the shelling."

[Thiqa agency published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKJi6vdRAmM) on their YouTube channel showing the destruction of the hospital. See still below:

![al-salaam01](assets/al-salaam01.png)

The video includes an interview with one of the medical staff who stated: "Russian aircraft targeted al-Salaam hospital after the Duhur prayer [noon prayer], the hospital is out of service now as a resulte of this attack, we have ten injuries, including three children."

[Hadi Alabdallah also published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6LrgHofQB4) showing the destruction in the incubators section of the hospital, see below:

![al-salaam01](assets/al-salaam02.png)

Another still from Alabdallah video shows the destruction outside of the hospital as seen below. We identified similar objects bewteen Hadi's video and Thiqa News Agency video.

![al-salaam01](assets/al-salaam11.jpg)

In the same video, Alabdallah conducted an interview with one of the hospital doctors who stated: "We were in the operations room when we surprised by a huge explosion caused by two missiles. We went out immediately to check the casualties. We had five victims and a number of wounded, in addition to extreme physical damage."

[RFS Media also published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH0g4bxbbAQ) showing the destruction in the front of the hospital.

The video also features an interview with a member of Syrian Civil Defence rescue team, who said: "The warplanes launched heaviest attacks on several areas in the southern countryside of Idlib. We are now in al-Salaam hospital in Maarat al-Numan, a civilian hospital, which was targeted by airstrikes, resulting in five victims and ten wounded".

[Maara Media Center (MMS) published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVU982I06rY) by Mohamed Aldaher showing the destruction outside of the hospital. See stills below:

![al-salaam01](assets/al-salaam04.jpg)

![al-salaam01](assets/al-salaam05.png)

The video contains an interview with one of Syrian Civil Defence members who stated: "Russian warplanes targeted Maarat al-Numan city with two air strikes targeting al-Salaam hospital and some shops surrounding it, killing six civilians."

[Eye On Homeland (EOH) also published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l9hy36AbZo) on their youtube channel showing the outside of the hospital, where the attack has caused a big destruction of shops surrounding al-Salaam hospital, see belows:

![al-salaam01](assets/outside01.jpg)

We identified objects between MMC video as well as eye on Homeland video to make sure that they are both in the same location.

![al-salaam01](assets/al-salaam12.jpg)

[Edlib Media Center also published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_bbjEXEUg) showing the first moments after the attack, see below:

![al-salaam01](assets/outside07.png)

## Where did it happen?

[Al Jazeera has published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1NBfJU5r7M), after the attack, showing rubble removal activities around the hospital, by Syrian Civil Defense rescue.

The Syrian Archive team was able to geolocate several landmarks and building using the above video and satellite images, thus confirming that the targeted location was the al-Salaam hospital and its surroundings. The below stills were taken from inside and outside the hospital:

We can compare the geolocation with the following satellite image taken from Digital Globe:

![al-salaam01](assets/BB2.png)

## When did it happen?

According to some testimonies in the previous videos, the airstrike took place after the noon prayer, [which was held around](https://timesprayer.today/6045-month01-year2018-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86.html) 11:38 AM on 03 Jan 2018.

At 11:48 AM on 13 January, a citizen reporter, based in Marrat al-Numan, [Anas Al Marwai, published a video](https://www.facebook.com/100010399271536/videos/543910859298885/) on his Facebook page showing the destruction around the al-Salaam hospital, see below:

![al-salaam01](assets/anas-alsalam.jpg)

Another Citizen reporter Mutie Jalal also published a tweet at 11:55 AM about the attack saying "Two Russian airstrikes on Sarakib and one on Maarat al-Numan and another one on Muharram":

Hadi Alabdallah [published another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LIEMU7tMIQ) showing the destruction of shops around the hospital, see below:

![al-salaam](assets/al-salaam10.jpg)

In the same video, Hadi said "Although it's raining and the sky is full of clouds, but the Russian warplanes do not stop flying and bombing the areas of Idlib countryside," and returning to [the weather on 03 January](https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/monthly/l/SYXX0099:1:SY) we found that January 3rd was a rainy and cloudy:

![al-salaam01](assets/al-salaam13.jpg)

## Flight Analysis Data

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross-referenced findings from the videos and witness testimony with flight observation data from a spotter organization. This process necessitated analyzing observation data for flights between 11:00 and 14:00, the period directly before and after the reported attack between 11:30 and 11:45 as was claimed by media activists. See belows:

![flight data](assets/marrat-al-numan-3-jan.png)

![flight data](assets/marrat-al-numan-3-jan2.png)

![flight data](assets/marrat-al-numan-3-jan3.png)

Through comparing where flights were observed, the type of aircraft observed, the time flights were observed, and the direction flights were heading, and comparing this data to geolocation conducted in earlier steps, the Syrian Archive was able to identify several flights potentially responsible for the attack (several fixed-wing Russian aircraft), seen circling in the immediate vicinity of the geolocated attack site starting from 11:41 AM. Previous research has found that circling flights typically indicate target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack.

While there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircrafts was involved in the attack on Atarib, the presence of these aircrafts increase the likelihood that an air attack occurred at this location and the time stated by the citizen reporters as well as humanitarian groups, and estimated also using imagery from the attack.

## Some of killed civilians names and pictures:

On his Facebook page, [Anas Al Marwai published a photo of a newborn babay girl from Ma'ar Shamareen](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=544037762619528&set=a.115427455480563.1073741828.100010399271536&type=3&theater) named "Tal Firas Al Omar", said that she died an hour after she was born in Al Salaam Hospital, as a result of the bombing the area by Russian warplanes.

Mukhils Kahttab, a citizen-based in Marrat al-Numan, [published a photo](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2018781351743914&set=a.2016163322005717.1073741829.100008362053367&type=3&theater) on his Facebook page to what he said it was "to his nephew, who killed as a result of the al-Salaam hospital targeting.".

The Syrian archives team could not find other victims's names for this attack.
