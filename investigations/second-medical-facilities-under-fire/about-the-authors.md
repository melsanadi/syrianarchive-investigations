This report has been written jointly by the following organisations:

### Syrian Archive

The [Syrian Archive][1] is a Syrian-led initiative striving to promote sustainable peace and respect for human rights within Syrian society through facilitating justice and accountability efforts. This includes evidence gathering and documentation of incidents; the acknowledgment that war crimes and human rights violations have been committed by all parties to the conflict; the identification of perpetrators to end the cycle of impunity; and the development of a process of justice and reconciliation. Through collecting, verifying, curating and investigating visual content, the Syrian Archive aims to preserve data as a digital memory to establish a database of human rights violations, and to act as a tool for legally implementing justice and accountability efforts as concept and practice in Syria.

Since its founding in 2014, the Syrian Archive has collaborated with organisations including Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International, University of California at Berkeley and the University of Essex, Witness, Bellingcat and various agencies of the United Nations (UN), specifically the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic.

### Syrians for Truth and Justice

[Syrians for Truth and Justice][2] is an Syria-based independent, non-governmental organization whose members include Syrian human rights defenders, advocates and academics of different backgrounds and nationalities. The initiative strives for Syria, where all Syrian citizens (males and females) have dignity, equality, justice and equal human rights.

### Bellingcat

[Bellingcat][4] is an award-winning investigative search network of using open source and social media content to investigate a variety of subjects, ranging from Mexican drug lords to conflicts being fought throughout the world. Bellingcat brings together contributors who specialise in open source and social media investigation, and creates guides and case studies so others may learn to do the same.
