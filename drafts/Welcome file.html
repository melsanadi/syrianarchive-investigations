<h2 id="background-of-maarat-al-numaan">Background of Maarat al-Numaan</h2>
<p>Maarat al-Numaan (also known as al-Maarra) is a city located 33 km south of Idlib, with a population of about 58,008 (2004 census), and so it’s considered as the second largest city in Idlib. Al-Maarra has a long history, and its museum has mosaics from Dead Cities, which date back to 1st to 7th centuries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBbgO3ujm0">The first demonstration</a> there took place On 25 March 2011, which called for freedom and Daraa, the city swiftly became an important hub for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxRnTy3-UCk">organizing protests</a>. The tenth month of 2012 saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aralZ54lXs">the control of Free Syrian Army</a> (FSA) on Maarat al-Numaan and since that date the city still out of the Syrian regime.</p>
<p>On 13 March 2016 al-Nusra Front and Jund al-Aqsa attacked the Free Syrian Army’s Division 13 in Maarat al-Numaan, overrun their depots, killing 4 of combatants and wounding as many as 20 others during the battle. Two Division’s storage facilities that filled with the U.S. manufactured anti-tank TOW missiles were surrendered to the al-Nusra. Ahmad al-Saaoud, a Syrian rebel commander, said the attackers had seized light weapons and ammunition from his group but had not managed to capture any TOW anti-tank missiles.</p>
<p>Civilian opposition against al-Nusra continued for several months in al-Maarra, until 6 June 2016 where the clashes broke out again. On 9 June, an agreement was signed between the Free Idlib Army and Tahrir al-Sham, which requires the Division 13 to be knocked down, the Free Idlib Army will also take over all the headquarters of Division 13 except one which will be managed by Tahrir al-Sham.</p>

<p>Al Salaam Hospital is a maternity hospital, which founded in 1995 in Maarat al-Numan. It contains all medical departments, including women’s clinics, orthopedics, and general surgery.</p>

<h3 id="previous-attack-on-idibs-hospitals">Previous Attack on Idib’s Hospitals</h3>
<p>The Syrian Archive has done in-depth two open source analysis about targeting medical facilities in Idlib governorate. The first one was entitled <a href="https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Medical-Facilities-Under-Fire/">Medical Facilities Under Fire</a> which addressed targeting eight hospitals and medical points including <a href="https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Medical-Facilities-Under-Fire/Incident-1.html">The national hospital of Marret Numan</a> whose beneficiaries was estimated about 500,000 people. The second report was under the heading <a href="https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Three-Idlib-Medical-Facilities-Attacked.html">Three Idlib Medical Facilities Attacked</a> and provided overviews of visual content regarding attacks targeted some of Idlib’s hospital and medical points.</p>
<p>This report presents an in-depth analysis of the last attacks on al-Salaam hospital especially the last one which led to becoming out of order.</p>
<h3 id="de-escalation-zone">De-escalation zone</h3>
<p>On 4 May 2017, the sponsoring states of Astana Talks (Russia, Turkey, and Iran) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF-gIL8yzk">signed a memorandum of understanding for the establishment of de-escalation zones in Syria</a> for at least six months, which <a href="https://sana.sy/en/?p=116911%5D">was extended</a> at Astana 7 on 31 October 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defense <a href="https://function.mil.ru/news_page/intrel/more.htm?id=12121964%40egNews">published a map showing</a> the locations included in this memorandum as shown below (de-escalation zones in blue, ISIS in grey, Syrian army in orange). See below:</p>
<p><img src="assets/atarib-3.png" alt="Russian MOD video"></p>
<p><img src="assets/atarib-4.png" alt="Map of de-escalation zone"></p>
<p>These areas included Idlib province, some parts of northern Homs province, as well as some parts of adjacent provinces (Latakia, Hama, and Aleppo), Eastern Ghouta in Damascus countryside and some parts of southern Syria.</p>
<p><img src="assets/al-numan.png" alt="al-salaam"></p>
<p>A zoomed in look at the Russian Ministry of Defense’s map (above) clearly shows that the bombed location in Maarat al-Numan city is part of the de-escalation zone established during the Astana talks.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened?</h2>

<p><img src="assets/anas-alsalam.jpg" alt="al-salaam01"></p>

<p>Hadi Alabdallah published another video showing the destruction of shops around the hospital, see below:</p>
<p><img src="assets/al-salaam10.jpg" alt="al-salaam"></p>
<p>In the video, Hadi said “Although it’s raining and the sky is full of clouds, but the Russian warplanes do not stop flying and bombing in the areas of Idlib countryside,”, returning to the weather forecast on 03 January we find XXXXXX</p>
<h2 id="flight-analysis-data">Flight Analysis Data</h2>
<p>To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross-referenced findings from the videos and witness testimony with flight observation data from a spotter organization. This process necessitated analyzing observation data for flights between 11:00 and 14:00, the period directly before and after the reported attack between 11:30 and 11:45 as was claimed by media activists. See belows:</p>
<p><img src="assets/marrat-al-numan-3-jan.png" alt="flight data"><br>
<img src="assets/marrat-al-numan-3-jan2.png" alt="flight data"></p>
<p>Through comparing where flights were observed, the type of aircraft observed, the time flights were observed, and the direction flights were heading, and comparing this data to geolocation conducted in earlier steps, the Syrian Archive was able to identify several flights potentially responsible for the attack (several fixed-wing Russian aircraft), seen circling in the immediate vicinity of the geolocated attack site. Previous research has found that circling flights typically indicate target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack.</p>
<p>While there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircrafts was involved in the attack on Atarib, the presence of these aircrafts increase the likelihood that an air attack occurred at this location and the time stated by the citizen reporters as well as humanitarian groups, and estimated also using imagery from the attack.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-killed-civilians-names-and-pictures">Some of killed civilians names and pictures:</h2>
<p>On his Facebook page, Anas Al Marwai published a photo of a newborn babay girl named “Tal Firas Al Omar”, said that she died an hour after she was born in Al Salaam Hospital, as a result of the bombing in the area by Russian warplanes, see below:</p>
