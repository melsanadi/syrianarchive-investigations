## What Happened?

On 25th February 2018, [Al-Shifuniyah town which is located in Douma city in Damascus countryside ](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=de&lat=33.558124&lon=36.440020&z=17&m=b&show=/1565461/Al-Shifuniyah&search=%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7) was targeted by chlorine gas, according to reports from media activists, humanitarian groups, news agencies, and the Syrian Civil Defense in the Damascus countryside in eastern Ghouta. Killed and injured people as a result of this attack was filmed and photographed and uploaded to social media platforms.

On the same day, [The Russian ministry of defense published](http://eng.mil.ru/en/news_page/country/more.htm?id=12164301@egNews) a briefing on Syria stating: "Evidence has shown that the leaders of illegal armed formations in the Eastern Ghouta are preparing a provocation using poisonous agents in order to accuse the government forces of using chemical weapons against civilians."

The same day of the attack, the reporter Yaser Aldoumani [published a video showing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vzolYe75_g) a killed child with a blue rope written on it "25/02/2018 Al-Shifuniyah as a result of chlorine gas". The video also shows injured children, and men being treated in a medical facility as a result of the claimed chlorine attack.

At 0:35 one f the civil defense members was saying "This child in Eastern Ghouta was brought to us from Al-Shifuniyah area on the 25th of February 2018. He was killed as a result of breathing chemical gas".
Another [video published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9x0xi-02wA) by the Syrian Civil Defence shows the same child that was effected by the chemical gas attack.

 [Damaski media agency published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9x0xi-02wA) showing Yousef Albostany who is the director of Damaski news agency. He said: "25-02-2018 on Sunday, we are in eastern Ghouta which was targeted by the Assad forces with chemical gas. This child was killed today as a result of the chemical gas attack. We don't know if it's the chlorine gas or another one. There are many other civilian injured as well including women, men and children."
