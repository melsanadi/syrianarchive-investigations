Chemical weapons are bad and not legal (ask Belgium for more info)

A story led approach - going deep into one story by one person where we can unpack other elements. E.g. A personal story of a witness of a chemical attack in a particular place, and then use this story to expand on elements to give context around (actors involved, what international bodies are doing about it, the casualties, types of chemical weapons used etc)

The use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict is illegal. Syria ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2013, following findings by the Organisation for the prohibition of Chemical Weapons that government forces had used chlorine bombs in an earlier phase in the conflict. International Humanitarian Law Rule 74 states that the use of chemical munitions are prohibited in both international and non-international conflicts.
