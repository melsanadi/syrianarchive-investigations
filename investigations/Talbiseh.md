## When did it happen

The Violations Documentation Center in Syria [published a report](http://www.vdc-sy.info/pdf/reports/1444252328-Arabic.pdf) on the Russian air raids on 30 September 2015, in which the Paramedic Omar Al Daqa (Abu Khaled Al Homsy), one of Talbiseh’s field hospital staff, recounted his experience:

“On Wednesday 30 September 2015, around 10:00 am, Russian warplanes launched several fierce airstrikes on Talbiseh city, targeting a number of neighborhoods with thermobaric missiles, including Karameh, Post, and Mashjer streets, as well as the city’s bread distribution center. The shelling was along one track with almost 100 meters between each missile. As a result, 17 civilians were killed, 34 were wounded, and one is missing (probably torn into pieces).”

Syrian Civil Defense member Dhiaa Abu Musaab (26), who was present during the airstrikes on the city of Talbiseh told the Violations Documentation Center:

“On 30 September 2015, at about 10:00 am, we were informed by the observatories that two warplanes were flying over the northern countryside of Homs, including over the city of Talbiseh. I took my video camera and rushed to the roof of my house to film them, but before I got there, the observatories requested civilians to instantly evacuate the streets, adding that the pilots were speaking Russian. A few seconds later, the warplanes launched eight vacuum missiles – specifically on the northern neighborhoods, which were crowded with civilians. The attack also hit a civilian bread distribution center, although there were no military headquarters in the targeted area. It was probably the first time that I saw a smoke cloud that large after an explosion. When I arrived at the scene, I saw three large holes in the street of different depths from one meter to two and a half meters. Some of the missiles had fallen directly between civilian houses and streets.“

The Center also [published](http://www.vdc-sy.info/pdf/reports/1444252328-Arabic.pdf) the names of the 18 people who were killed as a result of the airstrikes including children.

## Landmarks and Geolocation

"Talbiseh Mubasher" network also published [a video]((https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlQNhP6G0u7s&sa=D&ust=1539188171184000)) showing smoke rises as a result of airstrikes that targeted Talbiseh, showing a mosque minaret in front of the explosion site. The open source investigators team at the Syrian Archive found that this minaret belongs to [Al-Iman and Al-Rahma mosque](https://goo.gl/maps/43Sk5FnU9Cs) east of the town.

Below is a photo [published on google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/iZSk24sNV1F2) which shows the minaret of "Al-Iman and Al-Rahma" mosque, and behind it, the minaret of a second mosque.

Another [photo published](https://goo.gl/maps/CSHK4ByDq9R2) on google maps shows the mosque as well as the water tower.

Below is a google earth imagery showing [the water tower, school, the second and the third mosque in the area of the attack](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com.tr/maps/@34.8454128,36.730747,181m/data%3D!3m1!1e3&sa=D&ust=1539189669563000). Those landmarks are the same ones appear in the videos published above.

[Al-Kul Radio published](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Do233wvp_3AA&sa=D&ust=1539188171188000) a video one year after the incident which shows the damage of the [second mosque](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com.tr/maps/@34.843604,36.7278948,981m/data%3D!3m1!1e3&sa=D&ust=153918817118600).

Below is the geolocation of the the water tower on the right, and the third mosque with no minaret on the left. We can estimate how close the targeted site is from those landmarks according to the photographer movement and the smoke rises.

In the same [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4cP-FUFQrY), the second mosque minaret appeared for a moment, which shows how close the impact site is from the mosque.

 By comparing these images with the landmarks; we can accurately determine the photographer's track.

After matching the video with the satellite images and trying to link them; the open source investigation team of the Syrian Archive was able to determine the location of the partially destroyed school with its L-shaped construction, where the second mosque, whose minaret appeared clearly, is located east-south of it, and the water tower is west-south of it.

After identifying the photographer's track and the landmarks which include "Al-Iman and AL-Rahma" Mosque, the second Mosque, the third mosque that has no minaret, in addition to the water tower above Talbiseh castle; [the exact targeted location can be determined](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com.tr/maps/@34.8448492,36.7315971,103m/data%3D!3m1!1e3&sa=D&ust=1539188171190000), which is below:

## Conclusion

After collecting and analysing images and visual documentation published on social media platforms and news networks; the Syrian Archive's open source investigation team found that Talbiseh town in the countryside of Homs was targeted by Russian airstrikes on 30th September 2015.

It should be noted that hours before the airstrikes on the same day, the Russian Federation Council authorised President Vladimir Putin to use force in Syria as an official announcement to start Russian military operations in Syrian territory.

According to the analysed evidence and sources; between 10:00 and 11:00 am on the noon of 30 September 2015 Russian airstrikes targeted the north of Talbiseh town, followed by a second airstrike at the same site during the rescue operations resulting in a larger number of victims, especially within the Civil Defense members, where the death toll in the two attacks reached 18 victims and many wounded. The Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces launched about twenty precision airstrikes targeting eight objectives of the ISIS terrorist group at the territory of Syrian Arab Republic. Talbiseh city is not under ISIS neither Al Nusra controlled areas.
