### Prior Attacks on Nabed Al Hayat Hospital

This is not the first time Nabed Al Hayat Hospital is targeted. On Sep 8th 2018, SHAM Network published a video showing destruction of the hospital claimed to be as a result of an airstrike.

## Flight Data Analysis


## De-escalation Zone
On 4 May 2017, the sponsoring states of Astana Talks (Russia, Turkey and Iran) signed a memorandum of understanding for the establishment of de-escalation zones in Syria which took effect on 6 May 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defence published a map showing the locations included in this memorandum as shown below (de-escalation zones in blue, ISIS in grey, Syrian army in orange). Al Hass is located within the de-escalation zone.

## De-confliction mechanism

Since September 2014 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has
operated a humanitarian deconfliction mechanism to identify and protect humanitarian staff, offices, facilities, distribution sites, IDP sites, routes mobile clinics travel, etc. to the extent possible during kinetic operations by the Coalition Forces (“CF”) in Syria.

The Russian Federation and the Republic of Turkey air forces were not part of this original 2014 process; however, an agreement is in place with both countries to deconflict movement and static locations provided by humanitarian organizations.

Nabed AL Hayat hospital is deconflicted based on a facebook statement published by Mouhammed Khatoub.
