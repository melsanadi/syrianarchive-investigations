At approximately 21:05, warplanes targeted a [residential neighbourhood](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://earth.google.com/web/@36.04395964,36.75224262,319.55971579a,147.93847951d,35y,145.27914805h,0.15301545t,0r&sa=D&ust=1538476154379000) south of Zardana town near the [Saad bin Mu'adh mosque](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://earth.google.com/web/@36.04418524,36.75250114,319.86556206a,452.25160956d,35y,145.27877064h,0.15302276t,-0r/data%3DCmgaZhJeCiUweDE1MjU3MmM1MGRjOGQ0ZGY6MHhhMmZkYzhkY2Y3ZGQwODdiGTCE4n2xBUJAIXdiJ3Y6YEJAKiNTYWFkIGJpbiBmb3JiaWQKY29sbGVjdG9yIChXZXN0ZXJuKRgCIAEoAg&sa=D&ust=1538476154380000). This caused dozens of deaths and injuries, and destroyed dozens of homes.

Minutes after the airstrikes, at 21:22, activist Mohammed al-Abdu [published a post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid%3D468042146963362%26id%3D100012727414501&sa=D&ust=1538476154381000) describing the targeting of Zardana by the Russian airforce.

One witness interviewed by [Naba News Agency](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DBLwZlWwQbfg%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&sa=D&ust=1538476154383000) in their coverage of the incident stated: “After the incident, I rushed with members of Civil Defense to rescue the people who were trapped or injured people from under the rubble due to the massive destruction. Then came the surprise when the aircraft returned and bombed the same site roughly 30 minutes after the first strike. This led to new casualties among the Civil Defense members as well as to civilians who were rescuing the injured from the first strike. After the second strike, one of the Civil Defense members died, dozens of houses were destroyed due to both attacks. The impact sites are civilian locations that hold no military strongholds.”

In the same video, another witness spoke about the air strikes, stating that the strikes occurred after the Iftar meal and shortly before the Isha prayer. The witness said they they heard the noise of aircraft overhead, which he claims were Russian. Following this, he states that he heard a loud explosion. He stated that he was surprised at the scale of the destruction, and the number of individuals killed and injured that he saw when he rushed to the strike site.

Thiqa news agency [published a video report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DvCuO3SLaM6U&sa=D&ust=1538476154383000) documenting the scale of destruction. Their video report contains an interview with a witness of the air strike, who, similarly to the Naba News Agency report, also stated that the first air strike took place 15 minutes after finishing the Iftar meal (after the sunset prayer), and that the second air strike occurred 20-30 minutes after the first one. The video also includes a panoramic shot of the impact site.

Qasioun News Agency also published a [video report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DUNoVvij0Eqs&sa=D&ust=1538476154385000) in which one of those injured during the airstrike was interviewed. They stated: "After the Iftar meal, we heard a huge explosion sound and we saw a bright flash. Due to this explosion, a three-storey building was utterly destroyed. I lost seven or eight members of my family, along with more than 30 other victims."

Step News Agency published a video [showing rescue operations and the search for survivors](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-XrXN4jTvAk&sa=D&ust=1538476154386000) by Civil Defense members after the airstrikes.

SY Plus agency published a video report [in which one of the survivors of the airstrikes was interviewed](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DB_E0k0cBOf8&sa=D&ust=1538476154386000). The survivor stated: "After the Iftar meal, we went to work in our shops, and suddenly we saw a bright flash when airstrike took place. We tried to hide during this attack, which killed and injured people, in addition to the creating destruction and dust. We started to help those injured and extract them from under the rubble and transfer them to the cars to be taken to the hospital. Then, the Civil Defense team came to rescue the injured, and the second strike occurred, which had a higher number of casualties than the first."

A [report published by Aleppo Today](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/HalabTodayTV/videos/2247042018646557/&sa=D&ust=1538476154387000) contains interviews with a few of the witnesses of the two airstrikes. The Aleppo Today correspondent stated that the attack was committed by a [Sukhoi Su-24 aircraft](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-24&sa=D&ust=1538476154388000), which carried out two air strikes. One of the airstrikes used thermobaric rockets that destroyed an entire neighborhood, created a crater depth of 10 meters and caused the death of more than 35 victims and more than 80 injured. This included womenj, children and members of the Civil Defense.

Through comparing the [video report published by Aleppo Today during which documented the rescue operations at night](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/HalabTodayTV/videos/2247042018646557/&sa=D&ust=1538476154388000) and the [video report by SY Plus](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DB_E0k0cBOf8&sa=D&ust=1538476154389000) about the incident that was filmed the day after the airstrikes and shows the impact sites more clearly, Syrian Archive was able to confirm that both videos filmed the same location.

On Friday, 8 June 2018, the [Russian Ministry of Defence denied they had bombed Zardana](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://russian.rt.com/world/news/521128-minoborony-oprovergli-udar-siriya&sa=D&ust=1538476154390000), stating that fierce fighting with heavy artillery had taken place in this region between the large detachments of the *Al-Nusra Front* (designated as a terrorist organisation in Russia and a number of countries) and *Jaysh al-Islam*.

Despite claims made by the Russian Ministry of Defence the airstrikes are most likely Russian for a number of reasons. This includes the fact that the only active airforces in the region are Russian and Syrian, and also the fact that Syrian planes are unable to fly at night, according to a statement made by [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ria.ru/syria/20160921/1477468029.html&sa=D&ust=1538476154390000) to the Russian Information Agency (RIU).

It should also be noted that, according to several media sources including [Step News agency](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://stepagency-sy.net/archives/198035&sa=D&ust=1538476154391000), Zardana had seen some instances of fighting between *Jaysh Al-Ahrar* and *Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham*, and that fighting was renewed on 7 June 2018, resulting in the deaths and injuries including civilians. Fighting was instigated after a dispute broke out between these groups the previous evening.

[Reuters](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idlib/air-strikes-kill-at-least-38-in-syrias-idlib-monitor-idUSKCN1J40RH&sa=D&ust=1538476154393000) quoted the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights's statement that at least 44 people were killed on the night of 7 June 2018 due to airstrikes "suspected to be Russian" targeting Zardana, a town that was controlled by the Syrian armed opposition fighters.

It is worth mentioning that there is a Turkish observation point in Tal El-Eis roughly 20 km east of Zardana. In a [press conference](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue%3D106%26amp;v%3DoqUQxr-FU9I&sa=D&ust=1538476154393000) of the Russian Ministry of Defence concerning the observation points, it is possible to identify the Turkish observation point on Tal El-Eis on the map.

In a video [published by the citizen reporter Ahmed Rahal](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DwjS4WmBQn2k&sa=D&ust=1538476154395000) published by , one of those injured appears crying on the rubble after losing members of his family. As those nearby attempt to console him, he is heard saying: "I no longer have anyone," the second airstrike occurred in the same place. After that, the sound of the cameraman moaning can be heard. Near him, someone is heard saying "can anyone pull me out?"

All the witnesses interviewed by news agencies said that the strike took place after the Iftar meal and shortly before the night prayer. On Thursday, 7 June 2018, corresponding to [22 Ramadan](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dirarab.net/prayertimes/ramadan/Syria/Idlib&sa=D&ust=1538476154395000), sunset prayer call (the Iftar meal) was recited at 19:48, while the night prayer was recited at 21:18 (Zardana local time).

These times coincide with the testimonies of witnesses who said that the first airstrike occurred at around 21:00.

## Flight Data

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross-referenced findings from the videos and witness testimony with flight observation data from a spotter organisation. This process necessitated analysing observation data for flights between 20:30 and 22:00, the period directly before and after the reported attack as was claimed by media activists. See below:

<iframe height="800" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Zardana7June2018/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=y" width="800"></iframe>

[View full visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/profile/syrianarchiveorg#!/vizhome/Zardana7June2018/Sheet1?publish=yes)

Through comparing where flights were observed, the type of aircraft observed, the time flights were observed, and the direction flights were heading, and comparing this data to geolocation conducted in earlier steps, the Syrian Archive was able to identify a flight potentially responsible for the attack (a fixed-wing Russian aircraft), seen circling in the immediate vicinity of the geolocated attack site starting at 21:07 in Atarib, and then likely moving to Abin. Previous research has found that circling flights typically indicate target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack.

While there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircrafts was involved in the attack on Zardana the presence of these aircrafts increase the likelihood that an air attack occurred at this location and the time stated by the citizen reporters as well as humanitarian groups, and estimated also using imagery from the attack.



## Conclusion:

Zardana, a town north of Idlib, was targeted on Thursday night, 7 June 2018, at approximately 21:05, with an airstrike followed by another one about half an hour later, by aircraft likely to be Russian. The airstrikes targeted a [residential neighborhood](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://earth.google.com/web/@36.04395964,36.75224262,319.55971579a,147.93847951d,35y,145.27914805h,0.15301545t,0r&sa=D&ust=1538476154403000) south of Zardana, near [Saad bin Mua'dh mosque](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://earth.google.com/web/@36.04418524,36.75250114,319.86556206a,452.25160956d,35y,145.27877064h,0.15302276t,-0r/data%3DCmgaZhJeCiUweDE1MjU3MmM1MGRjOGQ0ZGY6MHhhMmZkYzhkY2Y3ZGQwODdiGTCE4n2xBUJAIXdiJ3Y6YEJAKiNTYWFkIGJpbiBmb3JiaWQKY29sbGVjdG9yIChXZXN0ZXJuKRgCIAEoAg&sa=D&ust=1538476154403000), killing 44 people, injuring dozens and destroying dozens of homes.

Thermobaric rockets were used in one of the two airstrikes, based on the destruction of the entire residential neighborhood, and the crater depth of 10 meters.

The Russian Ministry of Defence denied its warplanes were involved, and instead blamed the attack on artillery shelling between two fighting factions of Jaysh Al-Ahrar and Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham. Although the fighting started on the previous day, but there were no clashes in the targeted area, and all witnesses and injured confirmed that the bombardment was from aircraft flying that night, where high-explosive weapons were used.
