paramedic asked someone to bring him a Laryngoscope then after several seconds another man come and said "go to the car now, the tanks might explode.", the paramedic toke the child and went to a car.

The label return to baby called Abdullah Amir Sarjawi, 13 days old, the date of his admission was 04 February, and his parents live in Aleppo.

Hadi Alabdallah, a citizen journalist, [published a video on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcMurYLYlEo) showing destruction inside the hospital, injured including elderly men and women, fires outside of the hospital as a result of the attack, as well as the evacuation of babies and injured from the hospital by the Syria Civil Defense members.

In the video at 0:29, somebody asks the Syria Civil Defense members while they were carrying babies "Where are you taking babies?", someone can be heard answering "to the incubators, Syria Civil Defense taking them to the incubators."

In the same video at 0:49, Hadi Alabdallah said "a little while ago, Russian warplanes targeted the national hospital in Ma'arat al-Numan, which caused the hospital to be out of service, martyrs, wounded and trapped under the rubble as a result of targeting the National Hospital by these aircrafts. This hospital was containing large numbers of wounded, patients, babies. The babies who were inside the incubators were evacuated, some of them may be dying because they were evacuated under abnormal harsh conditions. Most parts of the hospital were damaged and destroyed."

At 1:47 said "Many medical facilities in Idlib have been attacked. The airforce is flying now over us and maybe it'll target this area in any moment because this hospital was attacked with more than 10 airstrikes so maybe it gets targeted again."

Another citizen reporter Moaz Alshami also published a video in front of the hospital shows Civil defense team were trying to put out fires, said: "After the massacre carried out by Russian aircrafts in Kafr Nabl city, the National Hospital in Maarat al-Numan is now targeting more than six air strikes. It is the only hospital operating here. It contains dozens of injured people who were injured in Kafr Nabl and taken here".

After that Alshami enter the hospital and said: "The Civil Defense evacuate the incubators. A few days ago, a massacre in Kafr Nabl and before it in Khan al-Sabeel and before it in Maazran, every day there is a new targeting of civilians."

At 4:31, Moaz Alshami conducted an interview with two women standing beside an injured. One of women said: "We are from Khan Sheikhan. We were in the hospital there, when it targeted. We came here and now this hospital has been targeted too. Where are we going?"
