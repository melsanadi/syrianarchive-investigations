The [Russian Ministry of Defense claimed](https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201806081065228869-russia-syria-strike-zardana-claims/) that they didn't strike Zardana. This investigation will use open source techniques to verify videos, photos and reports published online about this incident.

## What Happened?

On June 7th 2018, Zardana Al Hadath facebook page [published a post](https://www.facebook.com/Zerdna838/posts/441860366255086) about an airstrike that targeted Zardana at 21:14 Damascus local time.

On the same day at 22:06 Damascus local time, they [published another post](https://www.facebook.com/Zerdna838/posts/441875912920198) about a second airstrike that targeted the same impact site.

On June 12th 2018, Zardana Al Hadath facebook page [published a video](https://www.facebook.com/Zerdna838/videos/443894186051704/) showing the first moment of the second airstrike that targeted the same impact site where civilians were rescuing the injured and pulling out the dead from under the rubble as a result of the first airstrike. The sound of the aircraft can be heard at 00:31 of the video. Ibrahim Amon is one the civilians who died inthe second airstrike as he was rescuing civilians as shown in this [video](https://www.facebook.com/Zerdna838/videos/442940776147045/).

Step News Agency published a video [showing the rescue operations and the search for survivors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XrXN4jTvAk) by the Syrian Civil Defense members after the airstrikes.

another rescue video?????

One witness interviewed by [Naba News Agency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DBLwZlWwQbfg%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&sa=D&ust=1538476154383000) in their coverage of the incident stated: “After the incident, I rushed with members of Civil Defense to rescue the people who were trapped or injured. People were under the rubble due to the massive destruction. After 30 minutes of the first airstrike the aircraft returned and bombed the same impact site. This led to new casualties among the Civil Defense members as well as to civilians who were rescuing the injured from the first airstrike. After the second airstrike, one of the Civil Defense members died, and residential buildings were destroyed due to both airstrikes. The impact sites are civilian locations that hold no military strongholds.”

In the same video, another witness spoke about the airstrikes stating that they occurred after the Iftar meal and shortly before the Isha'a prayer. The witness said they heard the noise of the aircraft which he claimed to be Russian. Following this, he states that he heard a loud explosion and that he was surprised at the scale of the destruction, and the number of individuals killed and injured that he saw when he rushed to the impact site.

Thiqa news agency [published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DvCuO3SLaM6U&sa=D&ust=1538476154383000) documenting the scale of the destruction. Their video contains an interview with a witness of the airstrike, who, similarly to the Naba News Agency report, also stated that the first airstrike took place 15 minutes after finishing the Iftar meal (after the sunset prayer), and that the second air strike occurred 20 to 30 minutes after the first one.

Using the photage from the video, the Syrian Archive investigation team created a panoramic shot of the impact site which was the location of a residential building that was destroyed as a result of this attack.

Qasioun News Agency also published a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DUNoVvij0Eqs&sa=D&ust=1538476154385000) in which one of injured as a result of the airstrike was interviewed. He said: "After the Iftar meal, we heard a huge explosion sound and we saw a bright flash. Due to this explosion, a three floors building was utterly destroyed. I lost seven or eight members of my family. More than 30 other victims and the number of injured is not known yet."

SY Plus agency published a video [in which one of the witnesses of the airstrikes was interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DB_E0k0cBOf8&sa=D&ust=1538476154386000). The witness said that: "After the Iftar meal, we went to work in our shops, and suddenly we saw a bright flash when the airstrike took place. We tried to hide during this attack which killed and injured many people, in addition to destroying residential buildings. We started to help those injured and extract them from under the rubble and transfer them to the cars to be taken to the hospital. Then, the Civil Defense team came to rescue the injured, and the second strike occurred, which had a higher number of casualties than the first one."

A [report published by Aleppo Today](https://www.facebook.com/HalabTodayTV/videos/2247042018646557/&sa=D&ust=1538476154387000) contains interviews with a few of the witnesses of the two airstrikes. The Aleppo Today correspondent stated that the attack was committed by a [Sukhoi Su-24 aircraft](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-24&sa=D&ust=1538476154388000), which carried out two air strikes. One of the airstrikes used thermobaric rockets that destroyed an entire neighborhood, created a crater depth of 10 meters and caused the death of more than 35 victims and more than 80 injured. This included womenj, children and members of the Civil Defense.

Through comparing the [video report published by Aleppo Today during which documented the rescue operations at night](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/HalabTodayTV/videos/2247042018646557/&sa=D&ust=1538476154388000) and the [video report by SY Plus](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DB_E0k0cBOf8&sa=D&ust=1538476154389000) about the incident that was filmed the day after the airstrikes and shows the impact sites more clearly, Syrian Archive was able to confirm that both videos filmed the same location.

On Friday, 8 June 2018, the [Russian Ministry of Defence denied they had bombed Zardana](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://russian.rt.com/world/news/521128-minoborony-oprovergli-udar-siriya&sa=D&ust=1538476154390000), stating that fierce fighting with heavy artillery had taken place in this region between the large detachments of the *Al-Nusra Front* (designated as a terrorist organisation in Russia and a number of countries) and *Jaysh al-Islam*.

Despite claims made by the Russian Ministry of Defence the airstrikes are most likely Russian for a number of reasons. This includes the fact that the only active airforces in the region are Russian and Syrian, and also the fact that Syrian planes are unable to fly at night, according to a statement made by [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ria.ru/syria/20160921/1477468029.html&sa=D&ust=1538476154390000) to the Russian Information Agency (RIU).

It should also be noted that, according to several media sources including [Step News agency](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://stepagency-sy.net/archives/198035&sa=D&ust=1538476154391000), Zardana had seen some instances of fighting between *Jaysh Al-Ahrar* and *Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham*, and that fighting was renewed on 7 June 2018, resulting in the deaths and injuries including civilians. Fighting was instigated after a dispute broke out between these groups the previous evening.

[Reuters](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idlib/air-strikes-kill-at-least-38-in-syrias-idlib-monitor-idUSKCN1J40RH&sa=D&ust=1538476154393000) quoted the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights's statement that at least 44 people were killed on the night of 7 June 2018 due to airstrikes "suspected to be Russian" targeting Zardana, a town that was controlled by the Syrian armed opposition fighters.

It is worth mentioning that there is a Turkish observation point in Tal El-Eis roughly 20 km east of Zardana. In a [press conference](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue%3D106%26amp;v%3DoqUQxr-FU9I&sa=D&ust=1538476154393000) of the Russian Ministry of Defence concerning the observation points, it is possible to identify the Turkish observation point on Tal El-Eis on the map.

In a video [published by the citizen reporter Ahmed Rahal](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DwjS4WmBQn2k&sa=D&ust=1538476154395000) published by , one of those injured appears crying on the rubble after losing members of his family. As those nearby attempt to console him, he is heard saying: "I no longer have anyone," the second airstrike occurred in the same place. After that, the sound of the cameraman moaning can be heard. Near him, someone is heard saying "can anyone pull me out?"

All the witnesses interviewed by news agencies said that the strike took place after the Iftar meal and shortly before the night prayer. On Thursday, 7 June 2018, corresponding to [22 Ramadan](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dirarab.net/prayertimes/ramadan/Syria/Idlib&sa=D&ust=1538476154395000), sunset prayer call (the Iftar meal) was recited at 19:48, while the night prayer was recited at 21:18 (Zardana local time).

These times coincide with the testimonies of witnesses who said that the first airstrike occurred at around 21:00.

## Flight Data

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross-referenced findings from the videos and witness testimony with flight observation data from a spotter organisation. This process necessitated analysing observation data for flights between 20:30 and 22:00, the period directly before and after the reported attack as was claimed by media activists. See below:

<iframe height="550" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Zardana7June2018/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=y" width="780"></iframe>

[View full visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/profile/syrianarchiveorg#!/vizhome/Zardana7June2018/Sheet1?publish=yes)

Through comparing where flights were observed, the type of aircraft observed, the time flights were observed, and the direction flights were heading, and comparing this data to geolocation conducted in earlier steps, the Syrian Archive was able to identify a flight potentially responsible for the attack (a fixed-wing Russian aircraft), seen circling in the immediate vicinity of the geolocated attack site starting at 21:07 in Atarib, and then likely moving to Abin. Previous research has found that circling flights typically indicate target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack.

While there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircrafts was involved in the attack on Zardana the presence of these aircrafts increase the likelihood that an air attack occurred at this location and the time stated by the citizen reporters as well as humanitarian groups, and estimated also using imagery from the attack.



## Conclusion:

Zardana, a town north of Idlib, was targeted on Thursday night, 7 June 2018, at approximately 21:05, with an airstrike followed by another one about half an hour later, by aircraft likely to be Russian. The airstrikes targeted a [residential neighborhood](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://earth.google.com/web/@36.04395964,36.75224262,319.55971579a,147.93847951d,35y,145.27914805h,0.15301545t,0r&sa=D&ust=1538476154403000) south of Zardana, near [Saad bin Mua'dh mosque](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://earth.google.com/web/@36.04418524,36.75250114,319.86556206a,452.25160956d,35y,145.27877064h,0.15302276t,-0r/data%3DCmgaZhJeCiUweDE1MjU3MmM1MGRjOGQ0ZGY6MHhhMmZkYzhkY2Y3ZGQwODdiGTCE4n2xBUJAIXdiJ3Y6YEJAKiNTYWFkIGJpbiBmb3JiaWQKY29sbGVjdG9yIChXZXN0ZXJuKRgCIAEoAg&sa=D&ust=1538476154403000), killing 44 people, injuring dozens and destroying dozens of homes.

Thermobaric rockets were used in one of the two airstrikes, based on the destruction of the entire residential neighborhood, and the crater depth of 10 meters.

The Russian Ministry of Defence denied its warplanes were involved, and instead blamed the attack on artillery shelling between two fighting factions of Jaysh Al-Ahrar and Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham. Although the fighting started on the previous day, but there were no clashes in the targeted area, and all witnesses and injured confirmed that the bombardment was from aircraft flying that night, where high-explosive weapons were used.
