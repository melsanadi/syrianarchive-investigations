A few hours after publishing the first video, the same channel posted another video  [showing rescue operations,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpPfe3S5vvMc&sa=D&ust=1539188171180000) trail of destruction and victims of the raid.

On September 30, 2015, "Syria Revolutionaries Gathering" page published a video  [showing first moments of air raids launched by Russian warplanes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D66G9nXb1oCA&sa=D&ust=1539188171180000), according to the page, on the city's neighborhoods.

On the same day, "Syria Revolutionaries Gathering, Homs northern countryside - media office" channel published a video on YouTube [showing the first moments of air raids](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DO4cP-FUFQrY&sa=D&ust=1539188171181000) carried out by warplanes likely to be Russian, the arriving at the impact site, and subsequent rescue operations.

A clearer footage of the targeted area

When analysing footage in the videos, we noticed that in the video in which the photographer was riding his bike from west to east towards the second mosque; the shadows of objects were heading north and slightly tilted to the west. In September, [the sun begins to move southward](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.suncalc.org/%23/34.8423,36.7308,14/2018.09.30/10:48/1/2&sa=D&ust=1539188171182000), making the shadows extend northward. The shift of the shadows to the west in the video means that the sun has not yet peaked; which means filming was before the peak of the noon sun.

When searching for [the noon prayer time](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.al-hamdoulillah.com/ar/prayer-times/world/asia/syria/homs.html&sa=D&ust=1539188171182000) (at which the sun is at its peak) in Talbiseh and the surrounding areas on September 30; we found that the noon prayer call was recited at 12:23, which confirms that the documented air raid was carried out between 10:00 -11:00 shortly before noon on 30 September 2015.

The Violations Documentation Center in Syria published a report on the Russian air raids on 30 September 2015, in which the Paramedic Omar Al Daqa (Abu Khaled Al Homsy), one of Talbiseh’s field hospital staff, recounted his experience:

“On Wednesday 30 September 2015, around 10:00 am, Russian warplanes launched several fierce airstrikes on Talbiseh city, targeting a number of neighborhoods with thermobaric missiles, including Karameh, Post, and Mashjer streets, as well as the city’s bread distribution center. The shelling was along one track with almost 100 meters between each missile. As a result, 17 civilians were killed, 34 were wounded, and one is missing (probably torn into pieces).”

Syrian Civil Defense member Dhiaa Abu Musaab (26), who was present during the airstrikes on the city of Talbiseh told the Violations Documentation Center:

“On 30 September 2015, at about 11:00 am, we were informed by the observatories (radars) that two warplanes were flying over the northern countryside of Homs, including over the city of Talbiseh. I took my video camera and rushed to the roof of my house to film them, but before I got there, the observatories requested civilians to instantly evacuate the streets, adding that the pilots were speaking Russian. A few seconds later, the warplanes launched eight vacuum missiles – specifically on the northern neighborhoods, which were crowded with civilians. The attack also hit a civilian bread distribution center, although there were no military headquarters in the targeted area. It was probably the first time that I saw a smoke cloud that large after an explosion. When I arrived at the scene, I saw three large holes in the street of different depths from one meter to two and a half meters. Some of the missiles had fallen directly between civilian houses and streets.“

The Center also published the names of the 18 victims and photos of some of them.

On September 30, 2015, a video was published by "Talbiseh Mubasher" network of [the Russian air raids on Talbiseh town](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlQNhP6G0u7s&sa=D&ust=1539188171184000), showing a mosque minaret in front of the explosion site. The research team in the Syrian Archive found that this minaret belongs to "Al-Iman and Al-Rahma" mosque east of the town.

The Chief of the Presidential Administration Sergey Ivanov said that the decision related to the use of military air force only and not ground forces.

On 30 September 2015, the spokesman of the Russian Defense Ministry, Major General Igor Konashenkov said in a brief statement [that Russian forces launched about twenty precision airstrikes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqblmOvkV9KM&sa=D&ust=1539188171198000) targeting eight objectives of the ISIS terrorist group at the territory of Syrian Arab Republic, he added: “ Ammunition depots, weapons, fuel and lubricants, accumulation of military equipment have been struck as a result of the air strikes. Command control posts of the ISIS militias in the mountainous area have been completely destroyed. The civilian infrastructure and the nearby territory was not stricken." The website of the Russian Defense Ministry also published a video [showing targeting several locations inside the Syrian territory](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://eng.mil.ru/en/news_page/country/more.htm?id%3D12059172@egNews&sa=D&ust=1539188171198000) on 30 September 2015, the website reported that the aircraft which carried out the eight attacks took off from the [Bassel al-Assad airport](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://wikimapia.org/%23lang%3Dtr%26lat%3D35.421651%26lon%3D35.994987%26z%3D12%26m%3Db%26show%3D/13772226/Bassel-Al-Assad-International-Airport-Humaymim-Naval-Airbase&sa=D&ust=1539188171198000) (Hmeymim airfield) in Latakia countryside, and "performed high accuracy strikes against international terrorist organization ISIS."

On September 30, 2015, [Enab Baladi newspaper published a report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/47090&sa=D&ust=1539188171200000) where it quoted a statement by a US official that the United States believed that Russia had launched its air strikes on that day, as Moscow informed the United States of the attacks only an hour before they took place.

Enab Baladi reported that military aircraft likely to be Russian hit Talbiseh town using Thermobaric rockets, killing more than 20 civilians, including children and women.

After collecting and analysing images and visual evidence published on social media platforms and news networks; the research team in the Syrian Archive revealed that on 30 September 2015 Talbiseh town in the countryside of Homs was targeted by warplanes, likely to Russian, with two air strikes in the same location north of the town.

It should be noted that hours before the air raid on the same day, the Russian Federation Council authorised President Vladimir Putin to use force in Syria as an official announcement to start Russian military operations in Syrian territory.

According to the analysed evidence and sources; at about 11:00 am on the noon of 30 September 2015 Russian aircraft launched an airstrike using thermobaric rockets north of Talbiseh town, followed by a second raid at the same site during the rescue operations resulting in a larger number of victims, especially within the Civil Defense members, where the death toll in the two attacks reached 18 victims and many wounded. The Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces launched about twenty precision airstrikes targeting eight objectives of the ISIS terrorist group at the territory of Syrian Arab Republic, while the research team in Syrian Archive found that Talbiseh city is more than 100 km from the nearest point under ISIS control, which denies the Russian official explanation.

Shelling was carried out on a single north-south axis, which extended along Al-Karameh Street, the Post Street, in addition to the city’s bread distribution center, using eight rockets with almost 100 meters between each missile.
