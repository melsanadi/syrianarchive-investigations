## Background of Maarat al-Numaan

Maarat al-Numaan (also known as al-Ma'arra) is a city located 33 km south of Idlib, with a population of about 58,008 (2004 census), and so it's considered as the second largest city in Idlib. Al-Ma'arra has a long history, and its museum has mosaics from Dead Cities, which date back to 1st to 7th centuries.

[The first demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBbgO3ujm0) there took place On 25 March 2011, which called for freedom and Daraa, the city swiftly became an important hub for [organizing protests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxRnTy3-UCk). The tenth month of 2012 saw [the control of Free Syrian Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aralZ54lXs) (FSA) on Maarat al-Numaan and since that date the city still out of the Syrian regime.

On 13 March 2016 al-Nusra Front and Jund al-Aqsa attacked the Free Syrian Army’s Division 13 in Maarat al-Numaan, overrun their depots, killing 4 of combatants and wounding as many as 20 others during the battle. Two Division's storage facilities that filled with the U.S. manufactured anti-tank TOW missiles were surrendered to the al-Nusra. Ahmad al-Sa'aoud, a Syrian rebel commander, said the attackers had seized light weapons and ammunition from his group but had not managed to capture any TOW anti-tank missiles.

Civilian opposition against al-Nusra continued for several months in al-Ma'arra, until 6 June 2016 where the clashes broke out again. On 9 June, an agreement was signed between the Free Idlib Army and Tahrir al-Sham, which requires the Division 13 to be knocked down, the Free Idlib Army will also take over all the headquarters of Division 13 except one which will be managed by Tahrir al-Sham.

### Al-Salaam Hospital

Al Salam Hospital is a maternity hospital, which founded in 1995 in Maarat al-Numan. It contains all medical departments, including women's clinics, orthopedics, general surgery, urine, etc.

Before Jan 03, the hospital treats approximately 8,000 to 9,000 patients per month. Last month, the [hospital delivered 674 babies](https://www.facebook.com/alsalam.Hospital2/photos/a.390735564429659.1073741860.182840021885882/870621066441104/?type=3), and the total number of beneficiaries from its services reached 8670 patients, including 1789 in the internal clinic, 3356 in the pediatrics clinic, 2668 in the women's clinics, and hundreds of other patients in different clinics.

Al Salaam Hospital is the only maternity hospital in Maarat al-Numan, providing emergency services, medical consultations, as well as deliveries.

### Previous Attack on Idib's Hospitals

The Syrian Archive has done in-depth two open source analysis about targeting medical facilities in Idlib governorate. The first one was entitled [Medical Facilities Under Fire](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Medical-Facilities-Under-Fire/) which addressed targeting eight hospitals and medical points including [The national hospital of Marret Numan](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Medical-Facilities-Under-Fire/Incident-1.html) whose beneficiaries was estimated about 500,000 people. The second report was under the heading [Three Idlib Medical Facilities Attacked](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Three-Idlib-Medical-Facilities-Attacked.html) and provided overviews of visual content regarding attacks targeted some of Idlib's hospital and medical points.

This report presents an in-depth analysis of the last attacks on al-Salaam hospital especially the last one which led to destroy it and becoming out of order.

### De-escalation zone

On 4 May 2017, the sponsoring states of Astana Talks (Russia, Turkey and Iran) [signed a memorandum of understanding for the establishment of de-escalation zones in Syria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF-gIL8yzk) for at least six months, which [was extended](https://sana.sy/en/?p=116911]) at Astana 7 on 31 October 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defense [published a map showing](https://function.mil.ru/news_page/intrel/more.htm?id=12121964%40egNews) the locations included in this memorandum as shown below (de-escalation zones in blue, ISIS in grey, Syrian army in orange). See below:

These areas included Idlib province, some parts of northern Homs province, as well as some parts of adjacent provinces (Latakia, Hama, and Aleppo), Eastern Ghouta in Damascus countryside and some parts of southern Syria.

A zoomed in look at the Russian Ministry of Defense’s map (above) clearly shows that the bombed location in Maarat al-Numan city is part of the de-escalation zone established during the Astana talks.
